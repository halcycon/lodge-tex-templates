% Notices between Officers and Past Masters
%
% This file is intentionally minimal so it doesn't change pagination
% unless you add content. To add custom notices for a specific meeting,
% create `notices/<MEETING>-pre-pm.tex` and it will be used instead.
%
% Example (uncomment and edit):
% \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=2pt, topsep=2pt]
%   \item Visitors welcome; please advise the Secretary.
%   \item Dining: Please book with the Stewards by the Friday prior.
% \end{itemize}
