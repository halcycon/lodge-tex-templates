\AgendaItem{Risings}
\AgendaSubItem{First Rising - Grand Lodge Communications}
\linefrom{WM:}{Brethren, I rise for the first time...}

\linefrom{Sec:}{\stand{} \begin{itemize}
  \item WM, Brethren, I am required to inform you that I received a letter from the Metropolitan Grand Secretary, on behalf of the Grand Secretary, informing me of the outcome of disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Troy Andrew Taylor-Smith, who was expelled from the Craft on 16th July 2025, and announced as such at the following Quarterly Communications.
  \item WM, Brethren, the communications from Grand Lodge are circulated to the members by the "First Rising" e-mail, if anyone isn't receiving those communications please do let me know.
  \item WM, Brethren, I am required to remind the Brethren that they should not make contact with Masonic Lodges overseas without first having ascertained by application to the Grand Chancellor's Office (via the Secretary) the existence of regular Masonry in the country concerned.
  \item WM, Brethren, finally on this Rising, I will take the opportunity to remind the Brethren of the importance of registering for "Portal" - this is a UGLE-wide initiative, our uptake is "ahead of the curve" but I would like us to continue that trend, and to that end a QR code appears on the back of the Summons which will take you to the Portal registration page. Please come and see me if you have any questions.
\end{itemize}}

\AgendaSubItem{Second Rising - Metropolitan Grand Lodge Communications}
\linefrom{WM:}{Brethren, I rise for the second time...}

\linefrom{Sec:}{\stand{} \begin{itemize}
  \item WM, Brethren, the communications from Metropolitan Grand Lodge are circulated to Lodge Secretaries and then on to the members by a monthly newsletter e-mail. This is now in a "handy" PDF format and so I am able to distribute via our e-mail system. If anyone isn't receiving those communications please do let me know. I am conscious of course that this Lodge in not the primary Lodge for any of our members, though it may be the only Metropolitan Lodge for some.
  \item WM, Brethren, I have received a letter from W.Bro. Martin Vidler, our Metropolitan Grand Inspector, passing his best wishes to you, WM, and the Brethren of the Lodge. He would like to extend his Apologies for not being able to attend this meeting (it wasn't for the lack of me pressuring him, WM!) and looks forward to seeing us all soon.
  \item WM, Brethren, I am AGAIN going to take the opportunity on this Rising to remind the Brethren of the importance of registering for "Portal" - although this is a UGLE-wide initiative, Metropolitan Grand Lodge are pushing London Lodges to "lead from the front" and while our uptake is "ahead of the curve" it would be nice to get us to 100\% adoption.
\end{itemize}}

\AgendaSubItem{Third Rising - Lodge Communications}
\linefrom{WM:}{Brethren, I rise for the third time...}

\linefrom{Sec:}{\stand{} \begin{itemize}

  \item WM, I have received apologies from a number of Brethren, may I take them as read?
