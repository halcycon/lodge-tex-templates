\SectionNoTOC{General Notes}
Where items are deferred to another Brother, said Brother appears (in brackets) after the item.

This agenda is intended to be as comprehensive as possible, however no plan escapes first contact with the enemy!

\SectionNoTOC{Seating}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Joiners shouuld have reserved seating in the NE (near the SD), with joiners from foreign constitutions sitting West-most.
  \item Brethren Receiving their Grand Lodge Certificates should have reserved seats in the NW.
\end{itemize}

\SectionNoTOC{Floorwork and Ritual}
Horus is an Emulation Lodge and Emulation practice should be encouraged wherever possible. In practical terms this means:
\begin{itemize}
  \item NO SQUARING unless it is the most practical way of moving around the Lodge.
  \item Deacons ONLY bear their wands when attending on Candidates during a Ceremony, or during the opening procession and closing recession. At all other times, wands should be left in their stands.
  \item The JD alone changes the Tracing Boards.
  \item If wands ARE to be carried (by DC, ADC, SD or JD), they should be carried perpendicular to the floor, with a pencil grip, NOT a fist grip.
  \item Working Tools are not taken out for display unless for a ceremony.

\linefrom{Sec:}{\stand{} \begin{itemize}
  \item Brethren, I am required to inform you that I received a letter from the Metropolitan Grand Secretary, on behalf of the Grand Secretary, informing me of the outcome of disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Troy Andrew Taylor-Smith, who was expelled from the Craft on 16th July 2025, and announced as such at the following Quarterly Communications.
  \item Communications from Grand Lodge are circulated to the members by the "First Rising" e-mail, if anyone isn't receiving those communications please do let me know.
  \item I am required to remind the Brethren that they should not make contact with Masonic Lodges overseas without first having ascertained by application to the Grand Chancellor's Office (via the Secretary) the existence of regular Masonry in the country concerned.
  \item Finally on this Rising, I will take the opportunity to remind the Brethren of the importance of registering for "Portal" - this is a UGLE-wide initiative, our uptake is "ahead of the curve" but I would like us to continue that trend, and to that end a QR code appears on the back of the Summons which will take you to the Portal registration page. Please come and see me if you have any questions.

\AgendaSubItem{Second Rising - Metropolitan Grand Lodge Communications}
\linefrom{WM:}{Brethren, I rise for the second time...}

\linefrom{Sec:}{\stand{} \begin{itemize}
  \item Communications from Metropolitan Grand Lodge are circulated to Lodge Secretaries and then on to the members by a monthly newsletter e-mail. This is now in a "handy" PDF format and so I am able to distribute via our e-mail system. If anyone isn't receiving those communications please do let me know. I am conscious of course that this Lodge in not the primary Lodge for any of our members, though it may be the only Metropolitan Lodge for some.
  \item I have received a letter from W.Bro. Martin Vidler, our Metropolitan Grand Inspector, passing his best wishes to you, WM, and the Brethren of the Lodge. He would like to extend his Apologies for not being able to attend this meeting (it wasn't for the lack of me pressuring him, WM!) and looks forward to seeing us all soon.
  \item Brethren, I am AGAIN going to take the opportunity on this Rising to remind the Brethren of the importance of registering for "Portal" - although this is a UGLE-wide initiative, Metropolitan Grand Lodge are pushing London Lodges to "lead from the front" and while our uptake is "ahead of the curve" it would be nice to get us to 100\% adoption.
  \item The following Brethren have received honours from Metropolitan Grand Lodge and/or Chapter since our last meeting:
  \item If any Brother will be receiving LGR on November 5th but has not yet informed me, please e-mail me after the meeting for inclusion in the minutes.
