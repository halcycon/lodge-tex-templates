\SectionNoTOC{General Notes}
Where items are deferred to another Brother, said Brother appears (in brackets) after the item.

This agenda is intended to be as comprehensive as possible, however no plan escapes first contact with the enemy!

\SectionNoTOC{Seating}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Joiners shouuld have reserved seating in the NE (near the SD), with joiners from foreign constitutions sitting West-most.
  \item Brethren Receiving their Grand Lodge Certificates should have reserved seats in the NW.
\end{itemize}

\SectionNoTOC{Floorwork and Ritual}
Horus is an Emulation Lodge and Emulation practice should be encouraged wherever possible. In practical terms this means:
\begin{itemize}
  \item NO SQUARING unless it is the most practical way of moving around the Lodge.
  \item Deacons ONLY bear their wands when attending on Candidates during a Ceremony, or during the opening procession and closing recession. At all other times, wands should be left in their stands.
  \item The JD alone changes the Tracing Boards.
  \item If wands ARE to be carried (by DC, ADC, SD or JD), they should be carried perpendicular to the floor, with a pencil grip, NOT a fist grip.
  \item Working Tools are not taken out for display unless for a ceremony.

\linefrom{Sec:}{\stand{} \begin{itemize}
  \item Brethren, I am required to inform you that I received a letter from the Metropolitan Grand Secretary, on behalf of the Grand Secretary, informing me of the outcome of disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Troy Andrew Taylor-Smith, who was expelled from the Craft on 16th July 2025, and announced as such at the following Quarterly Communications.
  \item Communications from Grand Lodge are circulated to the members by the "First Rising" e-mail, if anyone isn't receiving those communications please do let me know.
  \item I am required to remind the Brethren that they should not make contact with Masonic Lodges overseas without first having ascertained by application to the Grand Chancellor's Office (via the Secretary) the existence of regular Masonry in the country concerned.
  \item Finally on this Rising, I will take the opportunity to remind the Brethren of the importance of registering for "Portal" - this is a UGLE-wide initiative, our uptake is "ahead of the curve" but I would like us to continue that trend, and to that end a QR code appears on the back of the Summons which will take you to the Portal registration page. Please come and see me if you have any questions.

\AgendaSubItem{Second Rising - Metropolitan Grand Lodge Communications}

\linefrom{Sec:}{\stand{} \begin{itemize}
  \item Communications from Metropolitan Grand Lodge are circulated to Lodge Secretaries and then on to the members by a monthly newsletter e-mail. This is now in a "handy" PDF format and so I am able to distribute via our e-mail system. If anyone isn't receiving those communications please do let me know. I am conscious of course that this Lodge in not the primary Lodge for any of our members, though it may be the only Metropolitan Lodge for some.
  \item I have received a letter from W.Bro. Martin Vidler, our Metropolitan Grand Inspector, passing his best wishes to you, WM, and the Brethren of the Lodge. He would like to extend his Apologies for not being able to attend this meeting (it wasn't for the lack of me pressuring him, WM!) and looks forward to seeing us all soon.
  \item Brethren, I am AGAIN going to take the opportunity on this Rising to remind the Brethren of the importance of registering for "Portal" - although this is a UGLE-wide initiative, Metropolitan Grand Lodge are pushing London Lodges to "lead from the front" and while our uptake is "ahead of the curve" it would be nice to get us to 100\% adoption.
  \item The following Brethren have received honours from Metropolitan Grand Lodge and/or Chapter since our last meeting:
  \item If any Brother will be receiving LGR on November 5th but has not yet informed me, please e-mail me after the meeting for inclusion in the minutes.

\AgendaItemNoNumber{Annex: Beer Tasting Notes}
\textbf{Opening Toast}\\
Today's meal has been paired in collaboration with Northern Monk Brewery, whose team has carefully selected a range of exceptional beers to complement each course.\\
The pairings have been designed to highlight balance, depth, and creativity â€” reflecting both the craftsmanship of the brewery and the quality of the dishes being served.\\
Each beer has been chosen not only for its flavour, but for the story it tells â€” whether that's celebrating innovation, tradition, or collaboration.\\

We'll begin with a shared pour that offers a bright and unexpected opening to the evening.\\
\vspace{4pt}\noindent{\color{black}\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}}\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{Starter - Northern Wild Brewing 005 / Gosnells / 10\% Blackcurrant \& Apple Mead}\\
For the first course, we have Northern Wild 005 â€” a 10\% Blackcurrant and Apple Mead produced in collaboration with Gosnells.\\
This mead is crafted using nouveau-style wine yeast, northern blossom honey, fresh apple juice, and handpicked blackcurrants.\\
It's a shared pour between two people, intended as an unexpected and celebratory opening to the evening.\\

The crisp apple and tart blackcurrant bring brightness and lift to the rich duck rillette, while the soft honeyed sweetness mirrors the orange dressing and golden raisins.\\
The result is a refined and refreshing start â€” a pairing that surprises and delights, setting the tone for the courses ahead.\\

\vspace{4pt}\noindent{\color{black}\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}}\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{Main - Patrons Project 50.01 / David Bailey / Extra, Extra Special Bitter / 6.2\%}\\
For the main course, we have Patrons Project 50.01 - David Bailey / Extra, Extra Special Bitter, part of Northern Monk's ongoing Patrons Project series, which celebrates creative collaboration and craftsmanship.\\
This beer has not yet been released, and today marks the first time it has been poured anywhere. It was packaged only this week, making it as fresh as beer can be.\\

The flavour balances toffee and biscuit malt with gentle caramel sweetness and a bright, leafy bitterness from Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops. Paired with the braised beef short rib, the malt profile reflects the caramelised shallots and truffle mash, while the fresh bitterness cuts through the richness of the dish.\\

The label features a peel-and-reveal design, allowing the story behind the beer and its artistic collaboration to be discovered directly on the can.\\

A classic British style reimagined with freshness at its heart â€” comforting, characterful, and a genuine first pour.\\

\vspace{4pt}\noindent{\color{black}\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}}\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{Dessert - Dark \& Wild 2025 / Evil Twin x Factory Brewing x Beak / 8.4\% Tiramisu Stout}\\
For the final course, we have Dark \& Wild 2025 â€” a Tiramisu Stout brewed in collaboration with Evil Twin, Factory Brewing, and Beak.\\
Part of Northern Monk's annual Dark \& Wild series, this beer celebrates the creativity and craftsmanship of dark brewing. It's made with coffee from Chipp Coffee Co., cocoa from York Cocoa House, and a rich malt bill supplied by Bairds Malt.\\

The result is a decadent stout with layers of espresso, cocoa, vanilla, and soft biscuit sweetness. Its smooth, creamy body mirrors the cappuccino mousse, while the roasted notes enhance the crumble and bring depth to the dessert.\\
The label features a peel-and-reveal design, offering the chance to uncover the full story behind the beer and its collaboration.\\
A truly indulgent conclusion â€” elegant, memorable, and full of character.\\

\vspace{4pt}\noindent{\color{black}\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}}\vspace{6pt}
\textbf{Closing Toast}\\
As we bring the meal to a close, a sincere thank you to Northern Monk Brewery for thoughtfully curating the pairings enjoyed tonight.\\
Although the team couldn't be here in person, their craft, creativity, and attention to detail have been present in every glass. Each beer has told a story â€” of innovation, collaboration, and the pursuit of flavour â€” and together they've elevated this dinner into something truly memorable.\\

Please join me in raising a glass to great food, exceptional beer, and the shared spirit of good company.\\

\textbf{Cheers!}
